How to increase productivity in teamwork 

Topic: Creating solutions to help increase the efficiency of coordination / cooperation among individuals in the group / organization, thereby improving overall work performance.

Measuring, tracking, and benchmarking developer productivity has been considered a black box. It doesn’t have to be that way.

- What are the impediments to the engineers working at their best level?
- How much does culture and organization affect their ability to produce their best work?
- How do we know if we’re using their time on activities that truly drive value?
- How can we know if we have all the software engineering talent we need?

3 types of metrics that need to be tracked:

- those at the system level
- the team level
- the individual level
