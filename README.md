## Topic:
How to increase productivity in teamwork 

## Solution: 
Creating a tool to help increase the efficiency of coordination/ cooperation among individuals in the group/ organization, thereby improving overall work performance.

Measuring, tracking, and benchmarking developer productivity has been considered a black box. It doesn’t have to be that way.
Compared with other critical business functions such as sales or customer operations, software development is perennially undermeasured. The long-held belief by many in tech is that it’s not possible to do it correctly—and that, in any case, only trained engineers are knowledgeable enough to assess the performance of their peers. Yet that status quo is no longer sustainable. Now that most companies are becoming (to one degree or another) software companies, regardless of industry, leaders need to know they are deploying their most valuable talent as successfully as possible.

### Leveraging productivity insights
With access to richer productivity data and insights, leaders can begin to answer pressing questions about the software engineering talent they fought so hard to attract and retain, such as the following:

- What are the impediments to the engineers working at their best level?
- How much does culture and organization affect their ability to produce their best work?
- How do we know if we’re using their time on activities that truly drive value?
- How can we know if we have all the software engineering talent we need?

### Understanding the foundations
To use a sufficiently nuanced system of measuring developer productivity, it’s essential to understand the three types of metrics that need to be tracked: 
- those at the system level
- the team level
- the individual level

### Usage:
Contribution analysis: Assessing contributions by individuals to a team’s backlog (starting with data from backlog management tools such as Jira, and normalizing data using a proprietary algorithm to account for nuances) can help surface trends that inhibit the optimization of that team’s capacity. This kind of insight can enable team leaders to manage clear expectations for output and improve performance as a result. Additionally, it can help identify opportunities for individual upskilling or training and rethinking role distribution within a team (for instance, if a quality assurance tester has enough work to do). For example, one company found that its most talented developers were spending excessive time on noncoding activities such as design sessions or managing interdependencies across teams. In response, the company changed its operating model and clarified roles and responsibilities to enable those highest-value developers to do what they do best: code. Another company, after discovering relatively low contribution from developers new to the organization, reexamined their onboarding and personal mentorship program.
